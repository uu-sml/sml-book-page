title: The Supervised Machine Learning book
tagline: Andreas Lindholm, Niklas Wahlström, Fredrik Lindsten and Thomas B. Schön
description: An upcoming textbook
---

When we developed the course [Statistical Machine Learning](http://www.it.uu.se/edu/course/homepage/sml/) for engineering students at Uppsala University, we found no appropriate textbook, so we ended up writing our own. It will be published by [Cambridge University Press](https://www.cambridge.org/) in 2021.

Andreas Lindholm,
[Niklas Wahlström](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/nikwa778/),
[Fredrik Lindsten](https://liu.se/medarbetare/freli29), and
[Thomas B. Schön](http://user.it.uu.se/~thosc112/)

A draft of the book is available below. **We will keep a PDF of the book freely available also after its publication.**


[**Latest draft of the book**](book/sml-book-draft-latest.pdf) ([older versions &gt;&gt;](https://github.com/uu-sml/sml-book-page/commits/master/book))

## Exercise material

Will eventually be added to this page. Meanwhile you may have a look at the material for our [course at Uppsala University](http://www.it.uu.se/edu/course/homepage/sml/).
